# GeoAuth Device API Specification

## Overview
The GeoAuth Device API provides the interface for user devices to send data to GeoAuth's servers. It allows for device registration, location updates, and location region creations.

## API Specification
### Format
Each endpoint is specified as a ``<URI> : <METHOD>`` pair. Parameters are listed below the HTTP specification (if there are any). A description then follows the parameter list.

### ``/api/device/register`` : ``POST``
Parameters:

* ``device_key``: a 32-character device registration key generated by ``/api/service/request-device-key``
* ``device_name``: the plain-English name of the device
* ``username``: the device owner's account username
* ``password``: the device owner's account password

This endpoint service device registrations. Devices must be registered with a device key generated by an API account (this is to prevent spurious registrations through sites not using the service). The registered device is associated with its owner's GeoAuth identity to track their location.

### ``/api/device/check-in`` : ``POST``
Parameters:

* ``device_id``: a 32-character device API key assigned to the device when it was registered
* ``latitude``: the latitude of the location update
* ``longitude``: the longitude of the location update
* ``time``: the time that the update took place

This endpoint services device location updates. It will verify that a device is registered with the given ``device_id``, and will not store updates sent from unregistered devices. Time is given as UTC.


### ``/api/device/add-region`` : ``POST``
Parameters:

* ``device_id``: a 32-character device API key assigned to the device when it was registered
* ``latitude``: the latitude of the location region
* ``longitude``: the longitude of the location region
* ``name``: the plain-English name of the region
* ``time`` (OPTIONAL): the time that the update took place
* ``radius`` (OPTIONAL): the radius of the circular area which should be considered part of this region

This endpoint services device location region creation. Regions are used to generate queries (i.e., "where were you yesterday at 6pm" can have a response like "home", which would be a region around the user's house). Variable radius allows for flexibility in spatial specificity.
